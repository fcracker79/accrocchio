# accrocchio
Accrocchio is a library to mark and being notified of smelly code (a.k.a, "accrocchio").

Example
-------

```python
from accrocchio.badgeofshame import accrocchio


class AClassThatSmells(metaclass=accrocchio):
    pass

@accrocchio
def a_function_that_smells():
    pass


accrocchio.how_many()     # here we have 1, as you have declared a smelly class
AClassThatSmells()
accrocchio.how_many()     # here we have 2, as you have created an instance of a smelly class
a_function_that_smells()
accrocchio.how_many()     # here we have 3, as you have invoked a smelly function

accrocchio.reset()
accrocchio.how_many()     # here we have 0

# You can also be notified of smelly code execution, such as:

from accrocchio import observers


class MyAccrocchioObserver(observers.AccrocchioObserver):
    def on_accrocchio(self):
        print('Another accrocchio!')

    def reset(self):
        print('Reset accrocchi')
observers.add_accrocchio_observer(MyAccrocchioObserver())
a_function_that_smells()   # prints 'Another accrocchio!'
accrocchio.reset()         # prints 'Reset accrocchi'

```

We intentionally:
1. Left out Python versions before 3.5, as we think they are a complete accrocchio. This library is useful only if a small part of the software is an accrocchio
2. Did not pass the accrocchio to the 'on_accrocchio' observer function, as you should treat all the accrocchios the same way
