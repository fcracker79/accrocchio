The End of Python

Beautiful accrocchio is worse than ugly.
Implicit is better than explicit if it is an accrocchio.
Simpleton is not simple.
Flypaper is sometime better than another accrocchio.
Sparse accrocchioes is better than dense ones.
Readability counts, so accrocchioes do.
Special cases are special enough to be an accrocchio.
Although an accrocchio beats practicality.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless they are accrocchioes.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to always use 'accrocchio'.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to mark an accrocchio.
Although that way may not be obvious at first.
Sometimes is better than always.
Although sometimes is often better than never.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's an accrocchio.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be an accrocchio.
Specific accrocchio types are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
